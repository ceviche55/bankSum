# CSV Bank Summary 
By: Khalid Hamu
___
This is a program written in python to take in data from an csv and output a summary into a new csv.

## Requirements
Make sure your computer has **python3** installed

To see if you have it installed go to your terminal or command prompt and run

`python3 -V`

If you get an error then look below for your system and follow the steps to install **python3**

### Mac or Ubuntu

Open the terminal and run

`sudo apt install python3`

### Windows

Go to the website

- https://www.python.org/downloads/

Now hit download, then proceed to install.

Then open the newly installed **python3**, which gives you a terminal to run commands

## Running the program

1. Move the input file you want to use to the folder containing the **main.py**
2. Rename it to "input.csv"
3. Open the terminal in the folder containing the file **main.py**
- On windows your right click (context menu) will have a new python addition
4. Run `python3 main.py`
5. A file named "out.csv" will have the output data

## Edits to main.py

- You can change the name of the file to input by changing the name of the input file name variable on line 15
  - (**Make sure you only change what is in between the quotation marks ""**)
- You can also change the name of the output file by changing the variable on line 51
  - (**Make sure you only change what is in between the quotation marks ""**)
- You can test the program with the data you gave me in the excel file by using the "testInput1.csv" and changing the input variable by doing what I said
